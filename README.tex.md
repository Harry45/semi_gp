### Gaussian Process Including Basis Functions

This is an extension of our work published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2102">MNRAS</a> and we also had a conference paper in <a href="https://iclr2020-fsai.github.io/FSAI/">ICLR 2020</a>.

In this work, we will emulate the MOPED coefficients only and is function of the following parameters:

$$
\left[\Omega_{\textrm{cdm}}h^{2},\,\Omega_{\textrm{b}}h^{2},\,\textrm{ln}\left(10^{10}A_{s}\right),\,n_{s},\,h,\,\Sigma m_{\nu}\right]
$$
